# System Design Exercises

This repository is a collection of my hands-on exercises and implementations focused on system design concepts. It includes practical demos, prototypes, and explorations of distributed systems patterns, fault tolerance techniques, caching, circuit breakers, scalability, consistency models, and more.

The goal is to deepen understanding of core system design principles by building and experimenting with real-world patterns using Go, Redis, HTTP APIs, message queues, and other relevant technologies.
