Circuit Breakers prevent **Cascading Failures**. (ðŸ’¡Like SQL Cascade)

Circuit breaker is a mechanism that stops a client repeatedly attempting an operation that is likely to fail.
> If a service is failing repeatedly, the circuit "breaks" the connection temporarily to stop more failures and allow the system to recover.

With respect to downstream services, a circuit breaker  calculates the number of requests that failed within a recent interval. If an error thresh- old is exceeded, the client stops calling downstream services. Sometime later, the client  attempts a limited number of requests. If they are successful, the client assumes that the failure is resolved and resumes sending requests without restrictions.

    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failures exceed threshold
    Open --> HalfOpen: After timeout
    HalfOpen --> Closed: If next call succeeds
    HalfOpen --> Open: If next call fails

    Open --> Closed: Manual reset (optional)
```

## Example Scenario

1. Service A calls Service B.
2. Service B is slow or down.
3. Circuit breaker detects repeated timeouts/errors.
4. Circuit opens â€” now Service A instantly fails requests to B (or uses fallback).
5. After some time, a few requests go through (half-open).
6. If they succeed, circuit closes again.
## Circuit Breakers Implementation

How is it implemented ?
- A common database holds the settings for each breaker.
- Services, before making call to others, checks the config
	- Cache the config to avoid checking the DB

## Using Libraries in Production

If you want more powerful and configurable circuit breakers, use:
